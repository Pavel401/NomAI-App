          Analyze the food product, product name and its nutrition label. Provide response in this strict JSON format:
          {
            "product": {
              "name": "Product name from front image",
              "category": "Food category (e.g., snack, beverage, etc.)"
            },
            "nutrition_analysis": {
              "serving_size": "Serving size with unit",
              "nutrients": [
                {
                  "name": "Nutrient name",
                  "quantity": "Quantity with unit",
                  "daily_value": "Percentage of daily value",
                  "status": "High/Moderate/Low based on DV%",
                  "health_impact": "Good/Bad/Moderate"

                  "issue": "Primary nutritional concern",
                  "explanation": "Brief explanation of health impact",
                  "recommendations": [

                }
              ]
            }
          }

          Strictly follow these rules:
          1. Mention Quantity with units in the label
          2. Do not include any extra characters or formatting outside of the JSON object
          3. Use accurate escape sequences for any special characters
          4. Avoid including nutrients that aren't mentioned in the label
          5. For primary_concerns, focus on major nutritional imbalances
          6. For recommendations:
             - Suggest foods that can be added to complement the product
             - Focus on practical additions
             - Explain how each addition helps balance nutrition
          7. Use %DV guidelines:
             5% DV or less is considered low
             20% DV or more is considered high
             5% < DV < 20% is considered moderate
          8. For health_impact determination:
             "At least" nutrients (like fiber, protein):
               High status → Good health_impact
               Moderate status → Moderate health_impact
               Low status → Bad health_impact
             "Less than" nutrients (like sodium, saturated fat):
               Low status → Good health_impact
               Moderate status → Moderate health_impact
               High status → Bad health_impact
